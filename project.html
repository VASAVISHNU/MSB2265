        <h1>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</h1>
        <ol>
         <p>Climate - majority of developed countries is located in a temperate climate. So they have often enough water, good soil, relatively stable weather, etc.</p>
         <p>Ocean, sea, navigable rivers and canals. They were later replaced / supplemented by infrastructure such as railways, motorways and airports are always a bonus. By the way, there are only a few developed countries that are landlocked.</p>
         <p> Lowlands are usually better than mountains.</p>
         <p> I'm not sure if there is a concept for it, but very simply - minerals are nice, but if you build an economy on them, you will fall into a trap. What happened during the Industrial Revolution is also largely based on raw materials such as coal and iron ore, but the timing was different.</p>
         <p> From the point of view of the continents, Europe really won this lottery. Although not whole, this continent also has "centers" and “peripheries”. For example, one of the reasons why the Balkan Peninsula is one of the “poorer” parts of the continent is not only its relative remoteness in the area, but also its mostly “not very lucky” geomorphological structure.</p>
        <p>Btw, this is a really great book about it.</p>
      </ol>
        </div>

        <h1>ECONOMICAL GEOGRAPHY</h1>
        <ol>
          <h2>Defination:</h2>
          <p>Economic geography is the study of geography of economic activities which studies economic activities and factors affecting them. It is the study of location, distribution and dimensional organization of economic activities across the globe.</p>
          <p>In fact, different authorities have defined Economic Geography in a variety of ways but their opinions converge at a common point of accord, where it means the study of the spatial distribution of man’s economic activities in relation to its environment, be it physical or non-physical.</p>
          <p>According to Dudley Stamp, Economic Geography “involves consideration of the geographi­cal and other factors which influence man’s productivity, but only in limited depths, so far as they are connected with production and trade.”</p>
          <p>R. S. Thoman in his book ‘The Geography of Economic Activity’ has remarked, “Eco­nomic Geography may be defined as an enquiry into the production, exchange and consump­tion of goods by people in different areas of the world. Particular emphasis is placed on the location of economic activity — upon asking just why economic functions are situated where they are in this world.”</p>
          <h2>Aims and Scope of Economic Geography:</h2>
          <p>We may consider the Earth as the abode of Man and its resources are his legacy. Being most dynamic, man is never satisfied with mere living. He has always tried to refine his living conditions and environment. He is; never satisfied with the simple food, nature has provided him; he has devised ways for preparing food.</p>
          <p>His shelters are not merely designed for simple protection, but should also be comfortable in every aspect and must match with the modern style. In fact, man satisfies not only his physical needs but also his cultural needs.</p>
          <p>These incli­nations or intentions of human mind have led to the exploitation of the earth’s resources in a number of ways down from days of Paleolithic society till the present time, but always within certain limits imposed by Nature. One unique feature of man is that, he understands the laws that govern the functioning of Nature and makes use of them in his own way of life.</p>
          <p>In this study of interdependence of production, emphasis should be given upon the de­gree of human initiative and the nature of physical forces enacting to shape certain life-patterns. They should be studied not in isolation but as a comprehensive system of interaction between man and Nature.</p>
          <h2>Importance of the Study of Economic Geography:</h2>
          <p>The main objective of Economic Geography is, as expounded, to examine man’s eco­nomic achievement in terms of production and consumption in the light of his environment. To assess the relative importance of the study of this branch of geography, we have to evaluate the purposes that it serves.</p>
          <p>Economic Geography, fundamentally, maintains a very close rela­tion with man’s economic welfare as other social sciences do; but the approach is radically different. Through various stages of interpretation and analysis it, in the final stage, attempts to point out the potential for development of a region, occupied by a certain group of people.</p>
          <p>The above condition may further be elaborated. The idea of the Damodar Valley Corpora­tion was inherited from the Tennessee Valley Authority of USA. But the DVC failed to maxi­mize the relative benefits as the TVA did.</p>
          <p>At the time of installation of the multipurpose river valley project in the Damodar Valley area only the aspects of physical setting were compared, ignoring totally the cultural elements like the level of technology, industrialization, capital availability etc.</p>
          <p>Economic Geography serves the purpose of identifying the influence that the environ­ment exerts on man through the preservation of the multiple geo-economic conditions of dif­ferent parts of the world. Any attempt that aims at the balanced development of economy could not succeed without the complete understanding of the man-environment inter-rela­tionship.</p>

         <h1>SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY</h1>
         <h2>Definition:</h2>
         <p>Social geography is the branch of human geography that is interested in the relationships between society and space, and is most closely related to social theory in general and sociology in particular, dealing with the relation of social phenomena and its spatial components.</p> 
         <h2>Issues</h2>
         <ul>
          <p>Issues such as tribal underdevelopment, agony of the masses hit by a syndrome of droughts, scarcities and famines, poverty, urban poverty and particularly rural poverty, social underdevelopment as expressed in il­literacy and levels of educational backwardness, destability in tribal areas in the wake of developmental projects, displacement of people by big river valley projects, disparities in levels of development in drought-prone, mountain and hill areas, etc., received increased re­search attention.</p>
          <p>This new academic environment enriched geography’s adaptability to social science discourse. In a way the JNU experiment laid down a new agenda for social geographical research building systematically on the tradition of V.L.S. Prakasa Rao and his associates who focused their efforts on the problems of perspective planning for national and regional development. Social geography at the JNU paved the ground for more give-and-take between disciplines, enabling geography to find a place in the realm of Indian social sci­ence.</p>
          </ul>
          <h2>Scope  of  Social Geography</h2>
            <p>Social Geography is primarily concerned with the ways in which social relations, identities and inequalities are created.</p>
            <ul>
              <p> How these social creations vary over space and the role of space in their construction is the principle distinction between sociology and social geography.</p>
              <i>Social Interaction and relations:</i>
              <p>According to PANOPIO,1997, Social interaction refers to the mutual inter stimulation and response between two or more persons and groups through symbols, language, gestures and expression of ideas.</p>
              <p> Social interaction is the foundation of society. Without interaction there would be no group life.</p>
            </ul>
            <ol>
              <i>Social interaction has different form of interaction:</i>
              <p> Between individual to individual.</p>
              <p>Between Individual to Groups</p>
              <p>Between groups to groups 4. Between individual and culture</p>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="strong">Formation of Social Groups</h2>
            <ol>
              <p> Unit of interacting personalities with interdependence of roles and statuses existing between and among themselves.</p>
                <p>• Collection of people where members interact on a regular basis, guide by structure and agreements, defined by roles and responsibilities.</p>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="strong">Characteristics of Social groups</h2>
            <ul>
              <p>Group members interact on a fairly regular basis through communication.</p>
              <p>Members should develop a structure where each member assumes a specific status and adopts a particular role.</p>
              <p>Certain orderly procedures and values are agreed upon. • The members of the group feel a sense of identity.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="strong">Types of Social Groups</h2>
            <p>Below are the types of Social Groups:</p>
            <ol>
              <p> Primary Group (Families, Play groups)</p>
              <p>Secondary Group (industrial workers, Faculty Staff)</p>
              <p>According Self-identification</p>
              <p> According to purpose</p>
              <p>According to geographic location</p>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="strong">Community and Society</h2>
            <ul>
              <p> The Primary difference between a community and Society is that a community is limited to a specific geographic location, but a society can be made up of people who live in different places.Another difference is that a society is made up of direct and indirect social connections between people, but a community is made up of individuals who are more closely connected. For example, people who live in town represent a community, whereas everyone who lives in the state the town is located in makes up a society.</p>
              <p>Several communities can be located within a society but each society is separate from another.</p>
              <p>Societies often include more diversity, with people from different backgrounds, social classes and races.</p>
              <p>People in communities most often share similar characteristics.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="strong">Concept of Social Space</h2>
            <p>• A social space is physical or virtual space such as a social center, online social media, or other gathering place where people gather and interact. • Some social spaces such as town squares or parks are public places and others such as pubs, websites or shopping malls are private places. • Henri emphasized that in human society all “Space is social: It involves assigning more or less appropriated places to social relations.</p>

          <h1>About us</h1>
          <h2>National geography:</h2>
          <h3>DEFINITION:</h3>
          <p>The National Geographic Society has been inspiring people to care about the planet since 1888. It is one of the largest nonprofit scientific and educational institutions in the world. Its interests include geography, archaeology and natural science, and the promotion of environmental and historical conservation.</p>
          <h2>Magazine History</h2>
          <ol>
           <p>National Geographic Magazine started publication in October 1888 as the official journal of the National Geographic Society, a nonprofit dedicated to funding science and exploration across the planet. Since then, National Geographic has grown to become one of the most iconic brands in the world. The magazine reaches around 60 million readers worldwide each month. Following in the footsteps of the magazine, the brand has expanded to include the National Geographic Channel, NationalGeographic.com and a social footprint that touches more than 30 million people. The magazine has a celebrated history as an innovative place for photography — from creating the first photographic survey of the night sky in the Northern Hemisphere to making the first color photographs undersea, and it continues to push technological and creative boundaries. Over time, the magazine has redefined itself as a committed outlet for world-class photojournalism, documenting the wonders of the planet and tackling serious issues around environmental and human rights.</p>
           <p>Today, National Geographic is expanding the scope of its visual storytelling, experimenting with digital experiences to find new ways of documenting the world and of allowing readers to interact with content. In addition to its leadership in photographic technology and storytelling, over the course of its history the magazine’s images have documented numerous discoveries and expeditions (many funded by the National Geographic Society), from the first American ascent of Everest to Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey’s work with primates in Africa to Jacques Cousteau’s dives and James Cameron’s historic solo descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in 2012. It has been a window on the world for generations of readers, and its photographic archives comprise 11.5 million images, including vintage glass-plate negatives and rare Kodachrome transparencies. The magazine is currently published in English and 40 local-language editions. It is also available on digital newsstands.</p>

                Physical geography is the study of the Earth's natural features, such as mountains, rivers, deserts and oceans. In physical geography, landforms and how they change are studied, as well as climate and its effects.

 
Key Vocabulary
The following geographical terms should be used and reinforced through this unit of work:

Capital city: the primary city in a country which is usually a focus for a country’s political, economic and cultural activities.

The four capital cities of the constituent nations of the UK:

Belfast (Northern Ireland),

Cardiff (Wales),

Edinburgh (Scotland) and

London (England).

Function: the main activities or purpose of a settlement. E.g. residential, industrial, commercial and recreational.

Housing types: such as terraced, semi-detached, detached, flats or bungalows.

Inner city: an area next to the city centre. Many inner-city areas are characterised by older and often terraced housing, although a number have been recently redeveloped with more modern buildings.

Land use: the way in which land is used by people. Examples could include housing, industry or green spaces (such as parklands or farming).

Market: the place where goods are sold.

Rural: relating to the countryside.

Service industry: work such as retail, administration, education, healthcare or tourism.

Settlement pattern: the shape and spacing of settlements, settlements might be linear (such as following the path of a road or river), dispersed (such as a number of farms), or nucleated (such as a densely settled village or town).

Settlement: a place where people live, which can be categorised into villages, towns and cities.

Shopping centres: shopping areas that are characterised by being undercover and having ample parking.

Site: the location of where a settlement first started.

Situation: the location of a settlement in relation to the surrounding area.

Suburb: the residential and commercial development at the edge of a city.

Urban: relating to a town or city.

Urbanisation: the increase in the percentage of people living in cities.

 
Examples
Pupils need to think about both the human and the physical features in the local landscape. It is sometimes the case that physical geography is overlooked when pupils are studying a relatively ‘built-up’ area, with the presumption sometimes being that there isn’t any physical geography in towns. However, most urban localities in the UK will have physical features underlying their human landscape, be it local streams, rivers or lakes, hills or valleys or areas of woodland and forest. See below for an example of a way of assessing prior human and physical geography knowledge.

                    Abstract
                    Economic geography is a branch of human geography that deals with all matters of economic interest, from livelihoods and resource extraction, to production and exchange, to consumption and disposal. The definition of what is economic includes what is within formal economies and paid labor as well as informal production and services and subsistence agriculture. These embrace all of capitalism as well as what is just beyond its boundaries. Fundamentally, economic geographies do not view the economy as distinct or independent from social, cultural, and political processes. A hallmark of economic geography is that it is ever-changing, applying, and incorporating new ideas from other disciplines to enrich our knowledge of things economic. The overriding concern of economic geographers is to understand the world as it actually exists, rather than as it might be modeled.
                    Economic geography, the study of the geography of economic activities, developed from a focus on commercial activities and the exploitation of resources for economic gain. The focus of the field includes sectors of economic activity and numerous specialties. The central concerns of economic geography include understanding the capitalist world economy and, at the local, regional, national, and global scales, several other topics: firms in all sectors, uneven economic development and restructuring, and work and workers. While these topics overlap with other subtopics, economic geography retains a central, umbrella-like role with respect to all aspects of the geographical dimensions of economic activity. It has grown to encompass social, cultural, political, and institutional influences that affect the geography of economic activities.

                What is Social Geography?
In a nutshell, social geography focuses on the scientific study of the relationship of society and space (spatial components). It is interested in answering the questions of how societal processes determine space and its structures and how spatial conditions determine the existence of societies. Social geographers work on matters of Europeanisation, the structuring of cities, the increasing impact of climate change and matters of globalisation. Studying social geography promises students an exciting and rich study career with a wide array of opportunities to study what you love.

Three reasons to study Social Geography:
If you are interested in combining social aspects with real life issues, you might very well opt for studying social geography. As a social geographer, you are able to tackle the big questions of our time such as that of climate change and migration.
As a master student of social geography, you are able to work with other students from multiple backgrounds. Your study group could consist of people who graduated from geography, social work, business studies or sociology before taking up social geography. This surely keeps discussions lively and interesting!
On the basis of real-life problems and guided by state-of-the-art theory, you will be able to acquire project management, presentation and visualisation skills that help prepare you for your working life and look great on your CV.
How to study Social Geography?
Social geography allows you to work both theoretically as well as practically. Topics on which your studies will focus are social challenges such as demographic change in rural areas and cities, spatial cultures and identities and how they can be developed further, migration and transformation of (parts) of societies, social diversity and the benefits and challenges it brings with it. Moreover, you will learn about innovative quantitative and qualitative methods in human/social geography. After successfully acquiring knowledge of the most important theories, concepts and methods, you will be able to put this knowledge into practice. Many study programmes enable their students to accumulate study credits by doing their own research project including fieldwork. It may also be possible you are taught by practitioners who pass on their first-hand insights to you. Often, study programmes require you complete an internship in your potential future work environment so as to graduate from social geography.

In order to study social geography, you may consider moving to another city as not every university offers study programmes in this subject. Assessments will vary across exams, coursework presentations, tutorials and fieldwork. Students will often be required to conduct research of their own, to answer a question of their choosing – generating exactly the sort of skillset that employers are seeking. This is often in a team, so students will be developing their skills in communications, delegation, research and management.

What kind of job can I get by studying Social Geography?
Given that social geography brings together many disciplines such as sociology, social work and business studies, you will have many options of finding the professional career that suits your personality and interests best. As a social geographer, you may work in research at a university or research institute, in public administration, in consultancy or other private companies.
